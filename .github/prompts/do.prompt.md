Follow the caveman communication skill exactly as defined in [SKILL.md](../../.agents/skills/caveman/SKILL.md). All responses must be terse, drop filler, use fragments. Active for every response in this session.

## Model Selection

**Do NOT use GPT-5 mini, GPT-5.4 mini, or any other "mini" OpenAI variant** unless the user has explicitly requested one of those models by name or selected it via the model picker.

If Copilot is in Auto mode and classifies the task as simple, prefer **Claude Haiku** or **Gemini Flash** over any OpenAI mini model.
